	<summary>Sitecore Helix-style library for managing "static" bits of on page text that need translation.</summary>
	<description>
Compatible with Sitecore 10.0
Requires Sitecore 10.0
Requires .NET Framework 4.8

Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.

This small Foundation kit contains classes and attributes to allow for "label" models. These models are handled in a sort of "view bag" parallel strategy to
the proper Model View Controller paradigm, because labels are usually not the actual model content, but inform the user how to read it. This technology is used
instead of the typical Sitecore Dictionary strategy, which does not support caching in a graceful manner.

More documentation will follow in the near future.
