	<summary>Sitecore Helix library to support context-aware pipeline, event and rule handlers.</summary>
	<description>
		Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
		The Foundation.Context namespace contains a contract for context-sensitive objects along with a context evaluator that compares
		the sensitive instances' runtime settings against their configured scope.

		The purpose of this library is to provide scoped pipeline handlers to Sitecore to prevent developers from unintentionally executing
		their customizations outside the scope of their current project/site/tenant/feature.

		Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
		Requires Sitecore 9.0 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
