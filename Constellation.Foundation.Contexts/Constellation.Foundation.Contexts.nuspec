	<summary>Sitecore Helix library to support context-aware pipeline, event and rule handlers.</summary>
	<description>
VERSION 10.1 is compiled for Sitecore 10.1 use and will not work on earlier versions.
Requires Sitecore 10.1
Requires .NET 4.8

Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
The Foundation.Context namespace contains a contract for context-sensitive objects along with a context evaluator that compares
the sensitive instances' runtime settings against their configured scope.

The purpose of this library is to provide scoped pipeline handlers and rules to Sitecore to prevent developers from unintentionally executing
their customizations outside the scope of their current tenant|site|request.
