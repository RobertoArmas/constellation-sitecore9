	<summary>Sitecore Helix library for classifying content based on whether the content is a page, a page fragment, and/or reusable.</summary>
	<description>
		Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
		The Foundation.Datasources namespace contains contracts for specifying whether an Item is meant to (primarily) be a context datasource,
		a subcontent datasource (unique to the hosting page) or a reusable page component (widget). This package includes rules for testing
		items based on inheriting from specific Templates.
		
		To flag an Item for use by the rules included, ensure they inherit from the appropriate Templates/Foundation/Constellation/Datasources template:
		* Context Datasource for pages.
		* Subcontent Datasource for content that appears exclusively on the hosting page.
		* Widget Datasource for content that can be shared by many pages.
		
		You must install the included package to get the Templates required to use the rules in this library.

		Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
		Requires Sitecore 9.0 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
		Requires the installation of the included Package.
