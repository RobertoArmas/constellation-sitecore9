	<summary>Sitecore Helix library for building out static navigation that doesn't necessarily reflect the shape or names of Items in the content tree.</summary>
	<description>
Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
The Feature.Navigation library solves the frequently occurring problem that the primary navigation or footer navigation of a website does not necessarily
share organization with the contents of the content tree. The reason may be differing SEO goals on URL construction, the need to name something differently
in navigation as opposed to the Page's heading values, or the need to construct a cross-cutting menu that draws Items from a wide variety of locations. This
library also gracefully handles the need to have external or document links within a static navigation system (such as a "fat footer").
		
Components:
- Navigation Menu - This is a marker item that specifies the root of a static navigation definition for a given website. There can be many of these on any particular
website. It is recommended that these Items become the Datasource of your Navigation renderings.

- Navigation Link - This is the conceptual member of a navigation and represent a hyperlink, visible to the user, that actually navigates somewhere else (as opposed to
click-to-open style links or buttons) Includes the link as a General Link with all its available options, as well as a flag to indicate the link text should come
from the Navigation Link Item's Display Name, which is the recommended approach to ensure the Navigation definition in Sitecore looks like what you see on page. Can be nested.
- Image Navigation Link - Because there's always some navigation that is represented via icons rather than text. Inherits from above.

- Link Group - Allows for the grouping of Navigation links into named groups. Very useful for pull-down navigation menu options, or Fat Footers with named columns.
Can be nested.

- NavigationRepository - Static class that accepts a Navigation Menu item and assembles a full tree-like ViewModel for immediate processing in your View.

When using NavigationLink objects, there are usually several opportunities to supply the text of a given link. NavigationLink.GetBestLinkText() evaluates all of them and attempts to
supply the best fit. The strategy is based on overriding the concept of "name". Here are the rules:
- If Use This Display Name is checked on the NavigationLink item, it wins.
- If the Link.Text is supplied by the user, it wins.
- If the Link.TargetItem exists and inherits from Page Navigation Title, and the field value is not null, it wins.
- If the Link.TargetItem exists its DisplayName is used.
- Assuming all other things are not true, use the NavigationLink's DisplayName. Note that in this condition if you intended to point to a Sitecore Item, you have a bad link.
