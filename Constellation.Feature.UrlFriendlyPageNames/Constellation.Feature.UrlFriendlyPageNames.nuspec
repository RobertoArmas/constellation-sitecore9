	<summary>Sitecore Helix-style library for transforming human-entered Item Names into SEO-friendly URL slugs.</summary>
	<description>
Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.

This small Feature contains a Sitecore Rule Action which must be installed (see provided package) in order to take advantage
of this library.
		
To use, an Item Saved rule must be created. The rule must have a condition that specifies that an Item is a "page" and therefore
needs an SEO-friendly URL. The rule action should be the one included in this kit. Rule options include:
- Replace Diacritics
- Clear Display Name (recommended so that marketers see the actual Item name and therefore URL slug for pages)
- Specify illegal characters to remove
- Replace spaces or remove spaces from names
- Force lowercase
		
It is up to the implementer to determine the nature of "page" Items. We recommend looking at Constellation.Foundation.Datasources for
rule conditions that are suitable for this specific task.
		

Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
Requires Sitecore 9.0 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
