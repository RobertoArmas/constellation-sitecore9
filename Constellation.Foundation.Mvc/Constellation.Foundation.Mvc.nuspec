	<summary>Sitecore Helix library to enhance MVC development in Sitecore.</summary>
	<description>
Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
		
The Foundation.Mvc assembly contains the following significant components:
		
* Base controller that infers the name and location of its view from the supplied RenderingItem.
* Base view that exposes key Sitecore Editor state facts for presentation decisions.
* GetRenderer pipeline handler that infers the name of the controller to run based upon the supplied RenderingItem
* RenderRendering pipeline handler that replaces cache key generation with a stronger cache key algorithm to address
controller re-use.
* RenderRendering pipeline handler that minifies output HTML before handing it off to the Response and Sitecore's HTML cache.
* Configuration file for managing the settings for above.

Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
Requires Sitecore 9.0 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
