	<summary>Sitecore Helix library to enhance MVC development in Sitecore.</summary>
	<description>
Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
The Foundation.Mvc assembly contains enhancements to Sitecore's MVC Rendering system:
		

GenerateRenderingSpecificCacheKey Mvc.RenderRendering pipeline processor:
Replaces the default GenerateCacheKey processor. Includes the ID of the Rendering in the cache key, this allows for multiple renderings with different presentation 
		to use the same Datasource and be cached by Datasource without issues.
		
		
MinifyAndAddRecordedHtmlToCache Mvc.RenderRendering pipeline processor:
Replaces the default AddRecordedHtmlToCache processor. Uses the WebMarkupMin library to process the output HTML, Javascript, and CSS and minify it to improve page
		delivery time through file size reduction. The default settings are "safe" but effective, however WebMarkupMin offers far more aggressive minification settings
		for the bold.

		
GetControllerRenderer Mvc.GetRenderer pipeline processor:
		Replaces the default GetControllerRenderer. Allows the developer to rely on the name of the Rendering to locate the appropriate controller to execute
		(convention over configuration). Very handy for Renderings that have a dedicated controller with one action that always produces the same output.
		

ConventionController:
		Provides a good base-class controller for Sitecore implementations:
		* Forces the use of the Index() controller action (overrides possible)
		* Provides the programmer with immediate access to the Rendering's DataSource and ContextItem (PageContext)
		* Requires the programmer to assemble the model from the above Items.
		* Automatically finds the View based upon the Rendering's XPath location in Sitecore
		
EditorCompatibleView:
		Replaces the stock MVC View, and provides methods for determining if the Page Mode "IsExperienceEditor" and "IsExperienceEditorEditing" which are
		of particular use if the View needs to change behavior to support editors.
		
ViewResolver:
		Independent engine for locating a View based on the Rendering Item's path in Sitecore. It has two configuration settings that allow the programmer
		to specify the location of Renderings in Sitecore (to trim the uneeded parts of the path) and also the location of the Views on disk. Areas are
		supported through a token replacement. See the provided config file for details.
		

Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
Requires Sitecore 9.0 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
