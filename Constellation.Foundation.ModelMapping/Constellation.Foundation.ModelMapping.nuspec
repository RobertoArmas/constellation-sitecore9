	<summary>Sitecore Helix library to enhance MVC development in Sitecore.</summary>
	<description>
		Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
		
		The Foundation.ModelMapping library is inspired by AutoMapper and is designed to provide a quick, non-ORM method of
		mapping Sitecore Items to ViewModels. There is zero configuration. Point the mapper at an Item and specify the output
		type and the Mapper will attempt to match Item fields to model properties, calling FieldRenderer on the field and
		mapping the result to the Model object. Attributes allow for a degree of traffic control. Don't forget to use
		@Html.Raw() on your Model outputs to support Page/Experience Editor mode.

		Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
		Requires Sitecore 9.0 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
