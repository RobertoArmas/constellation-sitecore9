	<summary>Sitecore Helix library to enhance MVC development in Sitecore.</summary>
	<description>
Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
		
The Foundation.ModelMapping library is inspired by AutoMapper and is designed to provide a quick, non-ORM method of
mapping Sitecore Items to ViewModels. String properties on your ViewModel will be mapped to FieldRendered values from fields with the 
same names. Integer, DateTime, and Uri property types can also be handled automatically, although you will not get page editor support
for these types. There are a number of Attributes that you can assign to your ViewModel's properties to change the behavior of the Mapper.

Usage: TModel viewModel = ModelMapper.MapItemToNew&lt;TModel&gt;(sourceItem);

Constraints:
- Your ViewModel must have a public, parameterless constructor.
- Only Writable, Public Instance properties will be mapped.
- Within Sitecore, your field names can be human-legible. ModelMapper will attempt to convert the field name to a valid Property name. Simpler names work best. 
You can use the Field's Display Name for better human legibility and keep the Field's actual name closer to a legit C# entity name.

This initial release does not support MultiList based field mapping. Stay tuned!

Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
Requires Sitecore 9.0 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
