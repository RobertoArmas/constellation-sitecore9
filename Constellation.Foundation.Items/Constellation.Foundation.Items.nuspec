	<summary>Sitecore Helix library that provides a strongly-typed Item framework for Sitecore.</summary>
	<description>
Constellation.Foundation.Items is a framework for Sitecore. It contains a few basic Interfaces and Classes that can be used to construct objects
that represent Sitecore.Data.Items but include a few features not found in the native Sitecore API. For Example:
		
* Support for inheritance chains without having to navigate through all Data Template definitions.
* Ability to limit Item-based method parameters to particular "types" of Items without having to perform inspections on the parameter inside the local scope.
* Ability to limit View Models to a specific Item "type".
		
Unlike Custom Item Generator and Glass Mapper, Full inheritance chains are supported, as well as Interface versions of all Data Template definitions to allow 
for contract-basd parameter specifications.

This library is best when paired with a code generation tool such as NVelocity or T4 templates. Code generation should use
Sitecore Data Template definitions to create Interfaces and Classes. These can be used to create instances of Items that support
multiple inheritance and contracts. Item objects typically have declared properties representing a given Item's fields.

Using Constellation.Foundation.Items makes Sitecore Items suitable for use with type-driven IoC or Dependency Injection scenarios,
such as MVC/MVP and MVVM patterns.

Includes example T4 templates and instructions for use with HedgeHog Team Development for Sitecore (TDS)

Configured for use with Sitecore 8.2.
Requires Sitecore 8.2 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
