	<summary>Sitecore Helix-compatible library to enhance access to Sitecore Caching APIs.</summary>
	<description>
VERSION 9.0.5 contains a breaking change from previous versions!

Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
The Foundation.Caching namespace contains a Cache facade class that allows a developer to cache an object to
either the Sitecore Cache or the System Web Cache.

In addition to providing quick access to these APIs, the facade also provides support for scoping cached objects at the following levels:
* Global
* Site
* Database

Now with Dependency Injection support. Request an ICacheManager from your service locator to use. Static Cache methods will be removed
from a future release.

Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0

Portions based on work by Christopher Giddings: https://cjgiddings.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/sitecore-caching-utility/ updated heavily
for modularity and to support Sitecore 9.0
