	<summary>Sitecore Helix-style library that handles requests for /ROBOTS.TXT and /SITEMAP.XML dynamically based on Sitecore content.</summary>
	<description>
Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.

The Feature.SitemapXml namespace contains Http Handlers which intercept the request before it hits Sitecore. The /robots.txt handler returns
a basic document stating that all agents have access to the sitemap.xml file. (there is an option to explicitly deny all agents as well).

For /sitemap.xml, the request is passed to a Sitemap Generator, which uses a Crawler to identify which Items to put in the resulting
XML document. The Generator also uses a Node class to parse the Items to identify what information belongs in each of the Items' records
in the XML output. Because this document can be expensive to generate, there is a built-in caching mechanism.
		
This library supports "global" defaults in the Sitecore *.config files, as well as Site-specific settings.

The system will function on a basic level "out of the box". Developers are encouraged to extend/replace the crawler and node classes for their 
solution and/or individual Helix Projects within the solution to better suit their needs.

Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
Requires Sitecore 9.0 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
